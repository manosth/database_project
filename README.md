# Database and User Interface for Prescriptions-R-X
This code was developed by <a href="https://github.com/manosth">Emmanouil Theodosis</a> for a class on  Database Management Systems (DBMS).

In order to use it, you will need XAMPP. To add it to XAMPP, you will need to create a new database in the XAMP interface named <b>precisely</b> "Prescriptions-R-X" (otherwise you will get errors stating that <your_db_name> does not have the tables defined in the files). After creating the database in XAMPP, select it, select import, and choose the file "Prescriptions-R-X.sql".
